# Tech-Conference
This is a project I built entirely using Bootstrap, creating a fully responsive and modern website for a tech conference.I personally developed every section — from the clean and welcoming Home Page to the detailed Schedule, the inspiring Speakers lineup, and the smooth Registration form. I made sure the site looks great and works perfectly on all devices by leveraging Bootstrap’s grid system and components.

Features I implemented include:
-Responsive layout with Bootstrap’s powerful utilities
-Intuitive navigation and clear content structure
-Stylish sections for Speakers, Schedule, About, Registration, and Contact
-User-friendly registration form for easy sign-up
-Consistent design and accessibility best practices

This project showcases my ability to build professional websites quickly and efficiently using Bootstrap, while focusing on user experience and clean design.
