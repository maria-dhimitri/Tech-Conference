# Tech-Conference
This is a project I built from scratch using Bootstrap and JavaScript to create a fully responsive, interactive, and modern website for a tech conference.I personally developed every part — from the sleek Home Page and dynamic Speakers section to the detailed Schedule, user-friendly Registration form, and easy-to-use Contact page. Using Bootstrap’s grid and components alongside JavaScript, I added interactive features that enhance the user experience across all devices.

Key features I implemented:
-Responsive design with Bootstrap for seamless layout on any screen
-Interactive elements powered by JavaScript for smooth navigation and form validation
-Organized content sections: Speakers, Schedule, About, Registration, Contact
-A clean, consistent, and accessible design

This project reflects my hands-on skills in combining Bootstrap’s design framework with JavaScript’s interactivity to deliver a professional, user-focused web experience.
